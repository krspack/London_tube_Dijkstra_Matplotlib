# London_tube_Dijkstra_Matplotlib
Dijkstra algorithm applied to London tube. Input: any two existing stations. Output: the quickest route between them + plot of the route in Matplotlib.

I got the idea from @AparnApu (https://github.com/AparnApu/LondonTube-as-Graph) and @MarkDunne (http://markd.ie/2016/04/10/The-London-Tube-as-a-Graph/) both of whom have used Networkx with an inbuilt function for the Dijkstra algorithm. I decided to omit Networkx for study reasons and try to write my own implementation instead. Thanks also to @MarkDunne for the data on stations and lines.
